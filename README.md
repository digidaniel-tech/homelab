Welcome friend,

I am Daniel, I am a full fledged nerd who loves to works with
everything from servers, network to code and automation.

I am a strong advocate for GitOps and using automations as much as possible,
to be clear, not everything should be automated but everything that can remove
waste (waste as time that is spent on repetetive tasks) should be automated as 
long as it is secure.

This repository is my Homelab in code, this repo is an repetentation on what I
am running in my Homelab and how my Homelab is currently configured. This is 
both for my own documentation but also to help and inspire others that want to 
do the same.

## Background

I setup my own Homelab in 2019 and have reinstalled it multiple times and every
time I had to figure out the same problems over and over again because I never
documented the work I had done, this change now!

Because this is a Homelab and not an production environment I often reinstall
the server to test new operation systems, other configurations or just fixing
a problem I have caused that I was not able to solve.. (Yeah I also take the
quick way out sometime)

## My Homelab

My Homelab is running Proxmox VE, I have run Proxmox pretty much since I
decided to setup my Homelab and I love it!

### What is Proxmox VE?
Proxmox Virtual Environment (Proxmox VE) is an open-source virtualization
platform that combines two powerful technologies: virtualization and
containerization.

It allows users to deploy and manage virtual machines (VMs)
and containers through a web-based interface. Proxmox VE supports various
virtualization technologies such as Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) for full
virtualization and LXC (Linux Containers) for lightweight containerization.
This versatile platform provides features like live migration, high
availability, backup and restore, as well as a flexible storage system.

Whether you're a small business or an enterprise, Proxmox VE offers a
cost-effective and efficient solution for building and managing virtualized
infrastructure. Proxmox is also commonly used by many Homelab entusiast so
there is alot of videos and tutorials out there on how to use each feature
that Proxmox has to offer.

## Hardware

### Network Infrastructure

I try to setup my network infrastructure as what an business would setup so
that I can learn the more advanced functionality that comes with professional
equitment, this is an ongoing process and I will keep updating it when my
budget allows.

## Contribute

Even if this is my own Homelab and I won't accept contribution but don't
heasitate to create a PR if there is something I could have done differently or
if there is something that looks really wrong, I am still learning and all help
is appreciated.
